learnyounode-code
====================

This is the code I write to pass each lesson in *learnyounode* the Node.js interactive tutorial.

I think *learnyounode* is awesome if you need a quickstart in Node.js.

If you're interested in *learnyounode* or other Node.js interactive tutorial checkout [http://nodeschool.io/](http://nodeschool.io/)


**I haven't finish the tutorial yet. There're still 5 lessons to go.**
